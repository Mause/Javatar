## Javatar Coding Guideline

- Commands starts with `Javatar`
- Use `QuickMenu` as much as possible (except make the changes hard to edit in the future)
- Variable name, function/method name, and source code file name in `underscore_case`
- Class name in `TitleCase`
- Sublime Text's imports on top follows by default imports then required imports
- Use 4 spaces as 1 indent
- Prefer 80x80 code size per method/function or smaller
